        <p>Undebatably the most successful era in OKC Thunder history (not counting the years in Seattle), the Kevin Durant Era of OKC saw a finals appearance and multiple conference finals appearances</p>
        <p>This era was arguably cut short due to shortcomings in the 2016 conference finals mixed with injury-riddled seasons in the 14-15 and 13-14 seasons for Durant and Westbrook respectively.</p>
        <p>This period of Oklahoma City basketball has its end foreshadowed by the trade of future MVP James Harden to the Houston Rockets</p>
