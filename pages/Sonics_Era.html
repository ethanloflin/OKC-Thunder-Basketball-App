        <h1>Seattle Supersonics</h1>
        <p>Prior to its tenure in Oklahoma City, the franchise was located in Seattle, Washington, until being relocated to OKC in 2008.</p>
        <p>Seattle was a fairly decorated franchise, boasting 6 division titles, 3 conference titles, and a 1979 NBA championship. </p>
        <p>Seattle saw its fair share of superstar talent, including players like Ray Allen, Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Nate McMillan, and Rashard Lewis. Future MVP and Finals MVP Kevin Durant would also spend 1 season here before relocation.</p>
        <p>Many NBA players, fans, and media members have long since campaigned for the league to either expand to or relocate a franchise to Seattle to replace the lost Supersonics, many believing that Seattle unfairly had its franchise ripped away by corporate greed.</p>
